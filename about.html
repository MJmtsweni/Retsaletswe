                Retsaletswe House Production prides itself in fighting against
                political social and economic injusticies. Our prime objective is to make our people aware of Their political, social and economic 
                oppression through the work of art. 
              </p>
              <p> <br>
                Leaders as well as the community need to identify themselves through the work of art 
                that poeple can reflect on or in Their work and to understand the peole's frustrations, their needs or his or her
                contribution either negative or positive. South African communities
                are the same, meaning the same problems one is subjected to, it is highly
                possible that the next community might be going through the same predicament.
